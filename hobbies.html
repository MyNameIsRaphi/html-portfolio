            <h2>Programming</h2>
            <p>
                I love programming. Since I started at the age of 17, I can't get enough of it. I actually had <br/>
                to force me to take some breaks, so I had enough time to study. One of my classmates was <br/>
                learing to code aswell. Me and him used to talk about Python (programming language) all day.<br/>
                I was nearly addicted to coding and I still love it.

                <h2>Football (Soccer)</h2>
            <p>
                Since I'm 7 years old, I love football. I used to play in a team in primary school. Still today<br/>
                I watch football and talk about it.

                <p>
                    To be clear I don't make music myself. But I love listening to music.
